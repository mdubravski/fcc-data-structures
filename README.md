# Free Code Camp - Data Structure Course

Implements of data structures and their respective functions from Free Code Camp's Data Structures course.

## Notes

### Data Structure
A data strucute is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively.

* essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms
* they help to mange and organize data
* they make code cleaner and easier to understand

### Abstract Data Type
A Abstract Data Type (ADT) is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to.

The interface does not give any spicific details about how something should be implemented or in what programming language.
* essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms
* they help to mange and organize data

### ADT VS DS
|Abstraction (ADT) | Implementation (DS) |
|------------------|---------------------|
| List             | Dynamic Array, LinkedList|
| Queue            | LinkedList based Queue, Array based Queue, Stack based Queue|
| Map              | Tree Map, Hash Map/Hash Table|
| Vehicle          | Glof Cart, Bicycle, Car|
