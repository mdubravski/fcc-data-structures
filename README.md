# Free Code Camp - Data Structure Course

Implements of data structures and their respective functions from Free Code Camp's Data Structures course.

## Notes

### Data Structure
A data strucute is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively.
* essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms
* they help to mange and organize data
* they make code cleaner and easier to understand

### Abstract Data Type
A Abstract Data Type (ADT) is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to.

The interface does not give any spicific details about how something should be implemented or in what programming language.
